<h5>ABOUT ME</h5>
 <p>I'm a student taking a year off of college to figure what inspires me and set goals around it. In my short journey, I have developed a strong awareness of the lack of early quality childcare and education in the United States - as well as in other underdeveloped countries - and the detrimental effects of using a one-size-fits-all approach in our schools. 
My passion now involves trying to help empower children, filling in their gaps in knowledge and setting them up for long term success. 
I am currently living in New York City while taking courses that will help me grow on a personal and professional level. I am also looking to volunteer in non-profits and other organizations who's focus is the same.</p>
